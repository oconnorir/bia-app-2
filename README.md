# Bia

[Bia](https://bia-grocery-app.herokuapp.com/) is a grocery list app created using React and Redux with a [REST API](https://github.com/oconnorir/bia-api-2) that serves up the data. I ran both locally during development and now they are hosted on Heroku.

### `Who is Bia for`

Bia came about from wanting to create something simple that everyone could use everyday. The motive behind it was to show my Mom that technology could be easy and useful.

### `What Bia means`

Bia is the Irish word for food. And Irish being my ancestry, I wanted to give Bia a name that was meaningful to me as well as to the project itself.

### `Where is Bia's future`

There are a few things I see for Bia's future. A login process for personalized use (in progress) and a selector and seperate database for other items other than food to name just a couple.
